**Robocup**

These are the robot designs I created for Robocup Open weight. 

These are my own creations and since I have graduated from the event, anyone rteading this is free to build off of any of my designs. My hope for this is to inspire others to build off of what I haev and use them to create even better concepts for the competition.

Included are:
- My 2020 design I planned on using for that year's competition - This is mostly tested but never created
- My 2021 design Which is pureley theoretical. It is a modefied version of the 2020 design built around a 20cm diameter




**2020 Design:**
This is the robot I planned on using for the 2020 competition (Which was cancelled due to covid). Some parts of the robot were tested but it was never completed as production stopped when the competition was cancelled

The specs of the robot are:
- 2x Teensy 4.0
- 1x Teensy 3.5
- 1x Open MV H7 (Omnidirectional mirror)
- 1x Spinning LIDAR
- 1x Bluetooth module
- 1x BNO-055 Accelerometer
- 2x Dribbler
- 2x Directional Kicker (I created models using both slider and geneva methods)
- 32x Photoresistors w/ LEDs (Controlled by 2 multiplexers)
- 12x Buttons w/ LEDs
- 2x IR laser module




**2021 Design:**
This is a robot built for the 2021 competition but since there is a significant chance that the competition will be cancalled, I have decided to thus release all of the robot files. This design is a smaller version built around the 2020 design created around a 20cm diameter instead of a 22 cm diameter

The specs of the robot are:
- 2x Teensy 4.0
- 1x Teensy 4.1
- 1x Open MV H7 (Omnidirectional mirror)
- 1x Spinning LIDAR
- 1x Bluetooth module
- 1x BNO-055 Accelerometer
- 2x Dribbler
- 2x Kicker
- 32x Photoresistors w/ LEDs (Controlled by 2 multiplexers)
- 8x Buttons w/ LEDs (Intead of individual LEDs, I am using a neopixel strip to conserve pins)
- 2x IR laser module
